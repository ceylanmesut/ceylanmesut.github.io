Hi there! I'm Mesut Ceylan and I'm a master student in Zürich/Switzerland, pursuing M.Sc. in Data Science within University of Zürich.

I'm dedicated and adaptive young professional with discipline, strong analytic and programming skills and multi disciplinary work experience.

Fundamentally, I'm coding on Python for my machine learning and deep learning projects and utilizing core libraries such as: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NetworkX etc.

I also benefit from unique visualization software Tableau for data visualization, NoSQL for database management and data extraction and R for statistical interpretation and calculations.

Deliberately, I'm looking forward to apply my skills of machine learning and deep learning on applications to contribute to business process of companies and research projects of leading universities.
