Hi there! I'm **Mesut Ceylan** and I'm a **machine learning engineer.**

Welcome to **my data science and machine learning portfolio blog.** 

Occasionally, I am sharing machine learning projects that I found interesting and worked on.

Therefore, this website includes **projects on machine learning** along with **brief theory and practical sections** with project posts.

I would be very glad to **further discuss your comments and suggestions** on projects and methodologies. 
Please contact with me **via e-mail** for your inquiries.
