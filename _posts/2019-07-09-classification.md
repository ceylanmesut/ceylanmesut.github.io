# Machine Learning Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Machine Learning Project on Python for Fraud Detection



 
* **Dataset**: Kaggle dataset that anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine- Machine Learning Group - ULB


* **Inspiration**: Identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.


* **Problem Definition**: Building binary classification models to classify fraud transactions,thus obtain high AUC and F1 score.


* **Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Approach:
* **0.Explanatory Data Analysis**: Understanding the dataset and generating deeper insight.


* **1.Models Againts Imbalanced Dataset**: Analyzing model behaviors againts class imbalance.


* **2. Combat with Imbalanced Dataset**: Combating with imbalanced dataset with undersampling and cost sensetive loss function methods.

## Models:
* **Probabilistic Models**:  Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
* **Non-Probabilistic Models**: Linear Support Vector Machine and Kernelized Support Vector Machine (Polynomial Kernel)

## Results
* **Probabilistic Models**:  Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
