<p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently pursuing <strong>Master of Science in Data Science at University of Zurich.</strong></p>

<p>Prior to starting my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor Degree in <strong>Industrial Engineering-Operation Research</strong>,
building strong foundation on <strong>Probability, Statistics and Optimization, Multivariate Calculus and Linear Algebra</strong> in Istanbul Technical University.</p>

I'm highly passionate about:

<p><li> Deep Learning (CNNs and RNNs)</li>
<li> Machine Learning (Both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning)</li>
<li> Computer Vision (Vision Algorithms and Localization)</li></p>

<p>Frankly, I'm amazed <strong>state of the art advancements of AI and Machine Learning</strong> and their <strong>real-life and research applications.</strong></p>

<p>On this website, I am going to share <strong>some projects</strong> that I found <strong>interesting and informative.</strong>
Personally, I am aiming to <strong>excel my skills</strong> even further by working on topics, ranging from <strong>theory to applied projects.</strong></p>

<p>Please feel free to check <strong>my github page</strong> and <strong>contact me</strong> if you would like to <strong>provide feedback, initiate discussion and collaboration and exchange ideas.</strong></p>
<p>You can reach me via <strong>e-mail or Linkedin.</strong></p>
